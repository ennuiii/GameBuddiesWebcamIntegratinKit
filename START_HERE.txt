✓ React 18+
✓ Socket.io server
✓ Zustand (or similar state management)
✓ Tailwind CSS (or equivalent styling)


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Common Issues:

Camera not showing?
  → Check browser permissions
  → Use HTTPS (required in production)

Remote video not connecting?
  → Check socket.io connection
  → Verify signaling events
  → Check firewall/NAT (use TURN server)

Virtual background not working?
  → Only works in Chrome/Edge
  → Verify WASM files are accessible
  → Check browser console for errors

High CPU usage?
  → Lower video resolution
  → Disable AI features on low-end devices
  → Use blur instead of image backgrounds

For detailed solutions, see README.md "Common Issues" section.


SUPPORT
-------

Need help?

1. Check documentation (start with QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
2. Review source code comments (well documented)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Use chrome://webrtc-internals for WebRTC debugging
5. Test with simple getUserMedia call first
